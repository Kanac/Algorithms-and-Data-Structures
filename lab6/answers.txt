#2. For NN = 1000 and 100 repetitions, the average number of comparisons is around 11018. (~10x NN)
    For NN = 100 and 100 repetitionns, the average number of comparisons is around 649. (~6x NN)
    For NN = 10000 and 100 repetitions, the average number of comparisons is around 155783. (~15x NN)


#4. C(0) = 0,
    C(n) = (1/n)(sum from m = 1 to n of ( (n-1) + C(m-1) + C(n-m) ) )

5.  Avg case - n log n
    Worse case - n^2

Usually unlikely to see the worse case in practice because the worse case would be picking a value completely away from the 
median. 
The implementation is not a stable sort because if we pick one of the repeats as a pivot, it may get swapped 
The implementation is not in-place because each recursive call creates a new stack in memory for the data structures used.
