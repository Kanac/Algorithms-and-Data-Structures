(Run that from one of the UBC ugrad computers, after you have transfered
your files there and tested to make sure they work correctly on our systems.)

Questions:

For the explanations, generally a sentence or two should be enough.
Type your answers directly in this file.

0.  Compile the program (using make).  What puzzle does it solve?

TODO:

1.  Edit solve.cpp to solve the MazeRunner problem, and set the code
to declare activeStates as ArrayStack or LinkedListStack.  (You should
only comment out one line and uncomment one line to do that.)
Do you see why it's called depth-first search (DFS)?
(If not, you can increase the delay in the usleep call to slow down
the animation.)
How many steps long was the solution it found?
Does it make a difference whether you use ArrayStack or LinkedListStack?

TODO:

2.  Edit solve.cpp to solve the empty Sudoku board.
What solution do you get?

TODO:

3.  Next, edit solve.cpp to switch to peg solitaire game (the class
is called Marble).  Run it to completion with the usleep delay set to 10000.
How long does that take on your computer?  Now, comment out the
usleep command as well as the two lines before it.  Now how long does it
take to solve?  (This is why we'll comment these out when we solve
harder puzzles.)

TODO:

4.  Edit solve.cpp to switch to the 3x3 slider puzzle.  Make sure
the usleep and print statements in solvePuzzle are still commented out.
Try solving the 3x3 slider puzzle.  What happens?  Why?
